    "qed": "QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is a measure that quantifieshow 'drug-like' a molecule is based on properties such as molecular weight,solubility, and the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.Adding functional groups that improve drug-like properties (e.g., small molecular size,balanced hydrophilicity) can increase QED, while introducing large, complex, or highly polar groups can decrease it.",
    "logp": "LogP is the logarithm of the partition coefficient, measuring the lipophilicityor hydrophobicity of a molecule, indicating its solubility in fats versus water.Adding hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains or aromatic rings) increases LogP,while adding polar or hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl or carboxyl groups) decreases it.",
    "donor": "Donor Number refers to the number of hydrogen bond donors (atoms like NH or OH) in a molecule,influencing its interaction with biological targets.Introducing additional hydrogen bond donors (e.g., hydroxyl or amine groups) increasesthe Donor Number, while removing or modifying these groups decreases it.",
    "similarity": "Similarity in this context is calculated using Morgan fingerprints, which represent molecularstructures, and Tanimoto similarity measures how structurally similar two molecules are based on their fingerprints.Modifying the core structure of a molecule significantly (e.g., ring opening or closing) decreases similarity,while smaller changes like side-chain substitutions tend to have a lesser impact on similarity.",
