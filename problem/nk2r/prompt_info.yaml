description: "This task is to design highly selective and high-affinity NK2R peptide agonists 
  that maximize ipTM in AlphaFold3 structural predictions, target is the Neurokinin-2 Receptor (NK2R, Uniprot ID: P21452)."

example_output: 'Each output new candidate must start with <candidate> and end with
  </candidate> in peptide sequence format (using natural amino acids). 
  Example one output: <candidate>ACDEFGH</candidate>'

mutation_instruction: 'Example operations include:
  1. Substitution of amino acids to improve stability
  2. Introduction of bulky residues for receptor selectivity
  3. Hydrophobic/polar residue balancing to enhance binding
  4. Modifications to increase half-life
  5. Altering sequence motifs to reduce similarity with NKA
  6. Property-specific optimizations toward ipTM improvements

# Optional, some extra requirements you would like to achieve
other_requirements: |
  1. Each candidate must be a valid peptide sequence composed of natural amino acids.
  2. The maximum length must not exceed 40 amino acids.
  3. The sequence similarity with the natural peptide NKA (HKTDSFVGLM) must be < 30% by mmseqs2, which is indicated 
  by pass_mmseqs, if it has a similarity from mmseqs2 lower than 30%.
  4. The primary optimization goal is to maximize ipTM against NK2R. But only when the pass_mmseqs is true and the length is not
  more than 40 it will have a non-zero ipTM value . 
  5. Avoid designs that may activate NK1R or NK3R to reduce side effects.

iptm: ipTM (interface predicted TM-score) is a confidence metric introduced in AlphaFold-Multimer and extended in AlphaFold3. 
  It evaluates the predicted accuracy of the binding interface between two molecules (e.g., a peptide and its receptor). ipTM ranges from 0 to 1.
  Higher ipTM values indicate that the predicted interface is highly reliable and structurally consistent.
similarity: the similarity of the candidate peptide to NKA (HKTDSFVGLM) by biopython, it is to guide to when the pass_mmseqs is False,
  a smaller similarity is desired. Note that this similarity is different from the similarity by
  mmseqs2, a similarity higher than 30% does not mean it has a similarity higher than 30% by mmseqs2.
