description: "This task is to design highly selective and high-affinity NK2R peptide agonists 
  that maximize ipTM in AlphaFold3 structural predictions, target is the Neurokinin-2 Receptor (NK2R, Uniprot ID: P21452).
  ipTM (interface predicted TM-score) is a confidence metric introduced in AlphaFold-Multimer
  and extended in AlphaFold3. It evaluates the predicted accuracy of the binding interface
  between two molecules (e.g., a peptide and its receptor). ipTM ranges from 0 to
  1. Higher ipTM values indicate that the predicted interface is highly reliable and
  structurally consistent."

example_output: 'Each output new candidate must start with <candidate> and end with
  </candidate> in peptide sequence format (using natural amino acids). Example one
  output: <candidate>ACDEFGH</candidate>'

mutation_instruction: 'Example operations include: increase or decrease peptide lengths, change structures'

crossover_instruction: ''

other_requirements: "1. Each candidate must be a valid peptide sequence composed of
   natural amino acids.2. The maximum length must not exceed 40 amino acids.
   3. The sequence similarity with the natural peptide NKA (HKTDSFVGLM) must be < 30%
   by mmseqs2, which is indicated by pass_mmseqs.4. The primary optimization goal is to maximize ipTM of our designed peptide against
   NK2R. But only when the pass_mmseqs is true and the length is not more than 40
   it will have a non-zero ipTM value . 5. Avoid designs that may activate NK1R
   or NK3R to reduce side effects."

iptm_ours: The iptm to our designed peptide, higher is better.

iptm_nka: The iptm to NKA, lower is better, our designed peptide needs to compete with it.

similarity: the similarity of the candidate peptide to NKA (HKTDSFVGLM) by biopython,
  it is to guide to when the pass_mmseqs is False, a smaller similarity is desired.
  Note that this similarity is different from the similarity by mmseqs2, a similarity
  higher than 30% does not mean it has a similarity higher than 30% by mmseqs2.
