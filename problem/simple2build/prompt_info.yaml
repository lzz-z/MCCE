# Write a description for your problem
description: 'This optimization problem is a problem to evaluate stellarator designs for ease of construction and deviation
    from a Quasi-isodynamic (QI) field, is to optimize QI stellarators to be realized using simpler, easier-to-manufacture coils. 
  Because the stellarator symmetric is True, you only need the r_cos and z_sin values.
  This representation defines a toroidal surface (topologically equivalent to a torus) using a two-dimensional Fourier series. 
  The surface maps the poloidal angle theta and the toroidal angle phi to a point in 3D space, described in cylindrical coordinates as (r, phi, z).
  The functions r(theta, phi) and z(theta, phi) are expanded as Fourier series:
  The radial coordinate r(theta, phi) is expressed as a sum of cosine and sine terms with coefficients r_cos[m, n] and r_sin[m, n], 
  where m and n are the poloidal and toroidal mode indices respectively. The argument of each term is (m * theta - NFP * n * phi), 
  where NFP is the number of field periods representing the toroidal symmetry of the surface.
  The vertical coordinate z(theta, phi) is similarly expressed using z_sin[m, n] and z_cos[m, n], but note that the cosine term here 
  uses (m * theta - n * phi) instead of being scaled by NFP.
  The full expressions are:
  r(theta, phi) = sum over m, n of [ r_cos[m, n] * cos(m * theta - NFP * n * phi) + r_sin[m, n] * sin(m * theta - NFP * n * phi) ]
  z(theta, phi) = sum over m, n of [ z_sin[m, n] * sin(m * theta - NFP * n * phi) + z_cos[m, n] * cos(m * theta - n * phi) ]
  These Fourier coefficients are stored in four separate arrays:
  r_cos contains the cosine coefficients for the radial component.
  r_sin contains the sine coefficients for the radial component.
  z_sin contains the sine coefficients for the vertical component.
  z_cos contains the cosine coefficients for the vertical component.
  The indices L and M specify the resolution of the boundary surface in the radial and poloidal directions.
  Typically, L ranges from about 3 to 12 and M from about 6 to 20, M must be an odd.
  Larger values allow more geometric complexity.Your just need to make sure the coefficient arrays r_cos and z_sin have the same shape (L, M).
  Typical choices for the mode numbers (L, M) are: Low: (3–5, 6–10) middle: (5–8, 9–15) high: (8–12, 15–20)'

# Optional, some extra requirements you would like to achieve
other_requirements: 'constraints are:
  edge rotational transform over number of field period >= 0.25,
  quasi isodynamicity residual (qi) <= -4,
  edge magnetic mirror ratio <= 0.2,
  aspect ratio <= 10
  max elongation <= 5
  violation threshold is 0.01, so only if feasibility value <=0.01 it will give a total score larger than 0, 
  meaning that if all items have 0 total score, priority should be given to improving feasibility.

l_delta_b: The minimum normalized magnetic gradient scale length quantifies how rapidly the magnetic field strength 
  changes near the plasma boundary, normalized by a geometric factor (typically a / NFP, where a is the minor radius and NFP 
  is the number of field periods).
feasibility: The normalized constraint violation is computed as the constraint violation (actual value minus target) divided 
  by the absolute target value, and the feasibility score is the maximum of these normalized violations (with satisfied 
  constraints treated as zero); a design is considered feasible if this score is ≤ 0.01.
