      "*   **SA Reduction:** Prioritize smaller, simpler ring systems and fewer stereocenters. Avoid fused rings and complex macrocycles. Introduce more acyclic chains.\n",

      "*   **GSK3β Reduction:** Incorporation of a hydrogen bond acceptor close to the region that will binds to GSK3β could potentially lead to potent inhibitors.\n",

      "*   **SA Reduction:** Prioritize smaller, simpler ring systems and fewer stereocenters. Avoid fused rings and complex macrocycles. Introduce more acyclic chains.\n",

      "*   **QED Improvement:** Maintain a balanced structure with common, well-understood functionalities and proper valences. Prioritize structures that conform to Lipinski's Rule of Five.\n",
      "*   **GSK3β Reduction:** Incorporation of a hydrogen bond acceptor close to the region that will binds to GSK3β could potentially lead to potent inhibitors.\n",
